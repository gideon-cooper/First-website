      <p>
        As i was completing the Repl.it problems i found one to be quite
        challenging to complete.In order to overcome this i found that i had to
        console.log my results every step of the way in order to understand how
        to values were changing and what i was doing wrong. This allowed me to
        pinpoint the code that was giving me the error and edit it to be
        correct. Through this i understood how important console.log is and why
        it is one of the first things a programmer should learn how to do.

      <p class="pheading">Neuroplasticity</p>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new neural
        connections throughout life. This can be achieved by means of practising
        a certain skill such as coding. By continually practising and retrieving
        information from your brain you can strengthen these neural links.As
        well as aiding in the learning of a new skill it can also help people
        who are suffering from some mental illness such as autism.

      <p class="pheading">Growth Mindset</p>
      <p>
        Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that ones talents can be gradually
        improved over time. This is in contrast to having a fixed mindset in
        which one thinks that his/her gifts are innate and has to be born with
        such gifts in order to achieve great things.I feel that if i implement a
        growth mindset into my learning journey it will allow me achieve alot
        more than a fixed mindset person would be able to. One way i can see if
        this mindset is working is to repeatedly test myself and see if im
        improving over time.

      <p class="pheading">
        An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML can be thought as creating a room arranging the furniture and
        everything where CSS is styling everything deciding the wall colour etc.
      </p>
      <p class="pheading">
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those
        ones).
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order in which the code executes from the beginning
        to the end.In this flow you may have loops in which you will continue
        looping through until you met some sort of condiiton for example in real
        life you shower everyday and the only way to break out of it is to
        shower and break the loop until the next day.
      </p>
      <p class="pheading">
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM is the document object model and is a model which describes
        everything making up a page in a tree like model. It starts with the
        document and goes down to individual elements and text nodes. This
        allows programmers to access these elements on the DOM model and change
        the style and the functionality of the element.

        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get the data from an array one must use the index of the
        corresponding data they want. Whereas objects require one to put the key
        name in order to access the data associated with it.
      </p>
      <p class="pheading">
        Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions are useful as they allow one to execute a bunch of code all at
        once and allow one to control when the function is executed.

      <h3>What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h3>
      <p>Date: 29/06/2020</p>
      <img src="csss-box-model.png" alt="Box model" width="300" />
      <p>
        First if we imagine that all our content that we write goes into a box
        we can better understand the differences between the three things. First
        the space between our actual content and the border is the padding. More
        padding means more space in the box. Next we have the border which is
        the space which is between the padding and the margin. Finally we have
        the margin which is the space outside the border. This affects how close
        or far our content is to another item.
