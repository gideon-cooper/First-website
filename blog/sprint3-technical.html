          <p class = "pheading">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</p>         
          <p>HTML can be thought as creating a room arranging the furniture and everything where CSS is styling everything deciding the wall colour etc.</p>
          <p class = "pheading">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</p> 
          <p>Control flow is the order in which the code executes from the beginning to the end.In this flow you may have loops in which you will continue looping through until you met some sort of condiiton for example in real life you shower everyday and the only way to break out of it is to shower and break the loop until the next day. </p>  
          <p class = "pheading">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</p> 
          <p>The DOM is the document object model and is a model which describes everything making up a page in a tree like model. It starts with the document and goes down to individual elements and text nodes. This allows programmers to access these elements on the DOM model and change the style and the functionality of the element.</p>
          <p class = "pheading">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</p>      
          <p>To get the data from an array one must use the index of the corresponding data they want. Whereas objects require one to put the key name in order to access the data associated with it. </p>
          <p class = "pheading">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</p>      
          <p>Functions are useful as they allow one to execute a bunch of code all at once and allow one to control when the function is executed.</p>
