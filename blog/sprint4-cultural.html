        <p class = "pheading">Neuroplasticity</p>         
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new neural connections throughout life. This can be achieved by means of practising a certain skill such as coding. By continually practising and retrieving information from your brain you can strengthen these neural links.As well as aiding in the learning of a new skill it can also help people who are suffering from some mental illness such as autism.</p>

        <p class = "pheading">Growth Mindset</p>         
        <p>Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that ones talents can be gradually improved over time. This is in contrast to having a fixed mindset in which one thinks that his/her gifts are innate and has to be born with such gifts in order to achieve great things.I feel that if i implement a growth mindset into my learning journey it will allow me achieve alot more than a fixed mindset person would be able to. One way i can see if this mindset is working is to repeatedly test myself and see if im improving over time.</p>
