        <p>As i was completing the Repl.it problems i found one to be quite challenging to complete.In order to overcome this i found that i had to console.log my results every step of the way in order to understand how to values were changing and what i was doing wrong. This allowed me to pinpoint the code that was giving me the error and edit it to be correct. Through this i understood how important console.log is and why it is one of the first things a programmer should learn how to do.</p>
